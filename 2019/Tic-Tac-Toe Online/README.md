# Tic-Tac-Toe Online
This contains the project in which I implemented a game of Tic-Tac-Toe which used an online peer-to-peer connection. 

This project was created using Visual Studio Community 2017.

All files are located in the folder: Homework8

Since I used Visual Studio's built in GUI editor for WinForms, each form was split into its own file. Below will be a very brief explanation of each file that I had a part in creating. Any file not listed below is either not source code, or was automatically generated by Visual Studio.

**Source Code Files:**
* ConnectForm.cs
	-This file holds the logic for events related to the "connect" form - which was the form in charge of establishing a connection between two players.
* ConnectForm.Designer.cs
	-This file holds the creating of the form itself as well as the different styling options of each item within the form.
* Program.cs
	-This file only serves as an entry point to the program, and only builds and launches the initial form.
* TicTacToe.cs
	-This file contains the logic concerning the actual TicTacToe game, as well as the button that would open the Connect form. This file includes the logic for sending messages back and forth once the connection is established.
* TicTacToe.Designer.cs
	-Same as ConnectForm.Designer.cs, but in charge of the TicTacToe form instead.
